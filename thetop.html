		<h2>The Top Penang</h2>
		
		<div class="desc-container">
		<p>
			
			Experience walk on transparent glass known Rainbow Skywalk, sure will give you a new experience that is different.<br>
			Pioneering Penang Bandaraya beauty by 360 degrees from point of view of a bird that fly freely on the air. 
			If you obsess with sunset atmosphere, highly recommended for you the Menara Komtar peak.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>
			
			In height 250 metres from land in level 68 Komtar Menara, sure not all people could venture it.<br>
			If activity on high like fox flying is as easy as an ABC for you, try stand here on the other hand to see your heart beating fast or not. 
			The panorama around Skywalk really fantastic amazing and not all destinations offer to you the view. 
			If you fear that you might get sunburn stand at Skywalk in daytime, do not worry because this activity opened until night.
			In fact, seeing the surrounding atmosphere with colorful lamp decorations at night is also more interesting like being in a heavenly state.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>
			
			
			On the ground floor of the Rainbow Skywalk there is also an Observation deck where you can see the surrounding atmosphere more comfortably.<br>
			There is air conditioning and more not as thrilling as on the Rainbow Skywalk.
			A rather interesting place in Penang that is suitable for the whole family to visit.
			Unfortunately, this place have to pay and not free like Penang Street Art.<br>
